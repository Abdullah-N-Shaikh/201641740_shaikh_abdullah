        <h1>Wireless Sensor Network For Toxic Gas Detection</h1>
        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>Gas leakage is one of the significant issues in the industry field, which toxic gases such as (Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and Carbon Monoxide (CO)) could cause a disaster. This leakage can cause injuries and fire, which damages the facilities. Current existing solutions for toxic gas detection that are used in industries are expensive, which raised the need for cheaper alternatives. According to GDS corporation, the average price for a fixed sensor for detecting a one type of toxic gas could cost $1000. The proposed solution is based on using a wireless sensor network consisting of cheap gas sensors detection which can cost less than 10$ per sensor. Then they will be connected in a mesh topology using Zigbee communication protocol to communicate the collected data from the sensor to the other nodes in the route till it reaches the gateway node. Then the gateway node will send the data to a cloud platform to process the data and use machine learning algorithms to predict what other toxic gases could exist within the collected data.</p> 
        <h3>Project Objective</h3>
        <p>The aim of this research is to develop a Zigbee-based gas leakage detection system using the cheaply available MQ-series gas sensors. Microcontrollers (Arduino or Raspberry PI) (sensors) and interface them with sensor and/or communication modules will be used. Because of limitation in communication range, sensors have to cooperate and rely on each other's information. Each sensor will detect the gas leakage in its surroundings and then transmit it to its neighbor(s) and so on until it reaches the final destination (e.g., control center or Sink). At the sink node an AI/ML technique should be used to predict the toxic gases other than that provided by the sensors based on the collected data.</p>
