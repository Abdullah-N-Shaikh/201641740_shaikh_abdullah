        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Computer networks represent a field upon which the entire world economy is based. This multidisciplinary program is designed to equip students with advanced and working knowledge to succeed in the field of computer networks by acquiring valuable tools and skills in designing, managing, and securing computer networks. As the world is becoming digital, this discipline is skyrocketing in terms of demand in the job market, for both large and small business enterprises.</p>
        <p>This program covers subjects related to wired and wireless networks, including network design and management, network security, internet of things, client server programming, and emerging technologies. A rich collection of specific topics is covered, including the fundamentals of networks (physical and data layers, switching, routing, transport, etc.), mobile computing and wireless networks (e.g. configurations, interference mitigation, wireless network architecture, multi-gigabit networks such as 5G/6G), network design (e.g. LANs, VLANs, InterVLAN routing, multicast listener discovery), and network programming. The programs also covers network management and security (cryptography, segmentation zones, secure protocols, firewall protocols, authentication and authorization, network management standards and applications, etc.), and wireless applications of internet of things (access technologies such as LoRaWAN, publish/subscribe messaging protocols such as MQTT and COAP, industrial access control for wireless sensors, etc.). A suite of emerging technologies in computer networks will also be covered.</p>
